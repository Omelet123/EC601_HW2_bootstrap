# EC601_HW2_bootstrap
### Hi! My name is Grace Gao. This is my first project of building website with bootstrap and firebase.
## Bootstrap webpage
First, I cloned the documents of bootstrap.<br>
The firt file named bootstrap-3.3.7-dist contains compiled documents of bootstrap.<br>
The second file named bootstrap-3.3.7 contains several template supported by bootstrap.<br>
In this file, I chose a template named offcanvas to build a webpage which shows my basic information and links of personal pages.<br>

## Friendly chat
First, I cloned basic documents of Friendly chat.<br>
Following the Guide, I build a firebase project and connect it with friendlychat.<br>
At first, it just shows the basic webpage which do not have any function.<br>

In order to realize the functions of website, we need to change codes in main.js.<br>

![database](https://github.com/Omelet123/EC601_HW2_bootstrap/tree/master/image/database.jpeg)<br>
To make sure the safety of friendly chat, we write the database rules and storage rules.<br>
At the end, we deploy our app using firebasw static hosting. It generate a address for me. I can use it to visit my app.<br>
